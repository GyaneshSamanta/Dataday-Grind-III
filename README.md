# Dataday-Grind-III
Official submission to Dataday Grind III by MLH. 
## What we did?
1. We used a dataset to analyse the pollution of Indian and US cities.

2. We compared the AQI(Air Quality Index) of Indian cities between pre and post-covid.

3. We also analysed the AQI during festival time to understand the AQI over seasonal changes.
